### In this tutorial, you will manually set up the build environment, create your first PyTorch Live project, and run it in an emulator or on your phone.

If you ended up here, your operating system is either Windows or Linux, or the PyTorch Live command line tool `torchlive-cli` failed for you. No worries, we have prepared manual steps for you to get started with PyTorch Live!

## Installation

PyTorch Live is powered by [PyTorch Mobile](https://pytorch.org/mobile) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). Both are active and flourishing open source projects and require the following dependencies:

<DevelopmentDependencies />

<AppleM1Note />

As a first step, let's follow their installation instructions to set up the development environment for Android and iOS.

### Set up the PyTorch

PyTorch Live uses `python3` to export PyTorch models for the PyTorch Mobile runtime. The export is part of each PyTorch Live app project initialization (see later steps). Run the following command to check if python3 is installed:


```shell
❯ python3 --version
Python 3.9.4
```

:::note

The version installed on your machine might be slightly different, but should at least be version `3.7` or above.

:::


If `python3` is not installed, you can download Python from the [python.org website](https://python.org), or install it via Chocolatey (Windows), apt (Linux), or Homebrew (macOS).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="chocolatey"
  values={[
    {label: 'Chocolatey', value: 'chocolatey'},
    {label: 'Apt', value: 'apt'},
    {label: 'Homebrew', value: 'homebrew'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="chocolatey">

  ```shell
  choco install python3
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="apt">

  ```shell
  apt install python3
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="homebrew">

  ```shell
  brew install python3
  ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Set up the React Native development environment

The React Native website has a very detailed step by step guide to install React Native on macOS, Windows, and Linux and for each of the two target OS Android and iOS.

Follow their installation instructions on: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

## Create a New Project

Now that we have set up the build environment, let's create a new PyTorch Live project and run it in an emulator or on your device.

### Initialize Your Project

For PyTorch Live beta, we provide a React Native app template, packed with AI demos and practical examples. Use the `npx react-native init` command to initialize your first PyTorch Live project.

```shell
npx react-native init MyFirstProject --template react-native-template-pytorch-live
```

Behind the scenes, the tool created a new React Native project and configured the build tools for mobile development. The project contains on-device AI models and interactive examples that use them.

This is what you should see after the project is initialized:

```shell title="Expected output"
❯ npx react-native init MyFirstProject --template react-native-template-pytorch-live
npx: installed 637 in 16.171s

                  Welcome to React Native!
                 Learn once, write anywhere

✔ Downloading template
✔ Copying template
✔ Processing template
✔ Executing post init script
✔ Installing CocoaPods dependencies (this may take a few minutes)


  Run instructions for Android:
    • Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected.
    • cd "/Users/raedle/Projects/MyFirstProject" && npx react-native run-android

  Run instructions for iOS:
    • cd "/Users/raedle/Projects/MyFirstProject" && npx react-native run-ios
    - or -
    • Open MyFirstProject/ios/MyFirstProject.xcworkspace in Xcode or run "xed -b ios"
    • Hit the Run button

  Run instructions for macOS:
    • See https://aka.ms/ReactNativeGuideMacOS for the latest up-to-date instructions.
```

### Run Your Project

We are almost there. Now let's navigate to the newly created PyTorch Live project folder:

```shell
cd MyFirstProject
```

And run the PyTorch Live project on Android:

```shell
npx react-native run-android
```

By default, the PyTorch Live app will run in an emulator. You can also run it on your own phone which may improve performance. To run it on your phone, connect your phone to your computer and enable Android's developer mode.

:::note
On Android 4.1 and lower, the Developer options screen is available by default. On Android 4.2 and higher, you must enable this screen. To enable developer options, go to **Settings > Developer options** and tap the **Build Number** option 7 times.

More details are on the Android [configure on-device developer options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).
